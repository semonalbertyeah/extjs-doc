            <p>Many classes have shortcut names used when creating (instantiating) a class with a
                configuration object.  The shortcut name is referred to as an <code>alias</code> (or <code>xtype</code> if the
                class extends Ext.Component).  The alias/xtype is listed next to the class name of
                applicable classes for quick reference.</p>
            <h3 id="access-levels">Access Levels</h3>
            <p>Framework classes or their members may be specified as <code>private</code> or <code>protected</code>.  Else,
                the class / member is <code>public</code>.  <code>Public</code>, <code>protected</code>, and <code>private</code> are access
                descriptors used to convey how and when the class or class member should be used.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Public</strong> classes and class members are available for use by any other class or
                    application code and may be relied upon as a stable and persistent within major product
                    versions.  Public classes and members may safely be extended via a subclass.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Protected</strong> class members are stable <code>public</code> members intended to be used by the
                    owning class or its subclasses.  Protected members may safely be extended via a subclass.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Private</strong> classes and class members are used internally by the framework and are not
                    intended to be used by application developers.  Private classes and members may change or
                    be omitted from the framework at any time without notice and should not be relied upon in
                    application logic.</p>

            <h3 id="member-types">Member Types</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Config</strong> - The configuration options for a class.</li>
                <li><strong>Property</strong> - Set once a class is instantiated. *See Read Only below.</li>
                <li><strong>Method</strong> - Actions that can be performed by a class.  Methods should be read as
                    instance methods and can only be called from a instance of a given class.  Static methods
                    that can be called directly from the class itself will have a <code>static</code> label next to the
                    method name.  *See Static below.</li>
                <li><strong>Event</strong> - Events are specific to the framework event system allowing for classes to
                    programmatically raise an event to be handled by one or more event handler methods.  DOM
                    events, while handled by the framework event system, are not specifically described
                    within the API documentation.  *For DOM events refer to the
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events">event reference</a> page from MDN.</li>
                <li><strong>Theme Variable</strong> - Variables used by the visual theme engine employed by the
                    framework.</li>
                <li><strong>Theme Mixin</strong> - Functions used by the visual theme engine employed by the framework
                    and may use values set in various Theme Variables.</li>

            <h3 id="member-syntax">Member Syntax</h3>
            <p>Below is an example class member that we can disect to show the syntax of a class member
                (the lookupComponent method as viewed from the Ext.button.Button class in this case).</p>
            <div style="position: relative;" class="show-inherited show-protected members">
                <div style="border: 1px solid #E4E4E4;" class="classmembers member-protected isNotStatic isInherited member-expanded" data-member-name="lookupComponent">
                    <div class="collapse-toggle">

                    </div>
                    <div class="source-class"><a href="javascript:void(0);">Ext.container.Container</a><div class="viewSource"><a href="javascript:void(0);"></a><a target="_blank" href="javascript:void(0);">view source</a></div></div>
                    <div class="member-header">
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="member-name-link"><span data-ref="method-lookupComponent" class="member-name"><strong>lookup</strong>Component</span></a>
                        <span class="params-list"> ( item )</span> : <span class="memberType">Ext.Component</span>
                        <div class="member-tags"><span class="protected">protected</span></div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Called when a raw config object is added to this container either during initialization of the <a href="javascript:void(0);">items</a> config,
                        or when new items are <a href="javascript:void(0);">added), or {@link #insert inserted</a>.</p>
                    <p>This method converts the passed object into an instanced child component.</p>
                    <p>This may be overridden in subclasses when special processing needs to be applied to child creation.</p>
                    <div class="detail-header">Parameters</div>
                    <p><span class="params-list">item</span> :

                    </p>
                    <div class="params-desc"><p>The config object being added.</p></div>
                    <div class="detail-header">Returns</div>
                    <span style="margin-left:12px;" class="memberType">Ext.Component</span>

            </div>
    
            <p>Let's look at each part of the member row:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Expand/Collapse</strong> - On the left-hand size of the member row is a control used to
                    expand and collapse each member row to show / hide member details.</li>
                <li><strong>Member Name</strong> - The name of the class member (<code>lookupComponent</code> in this example)</li>
                <li><strong>Method Param</strong> - Any required or optional params used by a method (or passed to an
                    event handler method) will be listed next to the method name within parenthesis
                    (<code>( item )</code> in this example)</li>
                <li><strong>Return type</strong> - The class instance or javascript object returned by the method or
                    property (<code>Ext.Component</code> in this case).  This may be omitted for methods that do not
                    return anything other than <code>undefined</code> or may display as multiple possible values
                    separated by a forward slash <code>/</code> signifying that what is returned may depend on the
                    results of the method call (i.e. a method may return a Component if a get method calls is
                    successful or <code>false</code> if unsuccessful which would be displayed as
                    <code>Ext.Component/Boolean</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Flags</strong> - Any flags applicable to the member will be displayed next (<code>PROTECTED</code> in
                    this example - see the Flags section below)</li>
                <li><strong>Member Origin</strong> - On the right-hand side of the member row is the class where the
                    member was initially described (<code>Ext.container.Container</code> in this example).  The source
                    class will be displayed as a blue link if the member originates from the current class
                    and gray if it is inherited from an ancestor or mixed-in class.</li>
                <li><strong>Member Source</strong> - On the right-hand side below the member origin class is a link to
                    view the member's source (<code>view source</code> in the example)</li>
                <li><strong>Params List</strong> - Each param for a class method will be listed using the same name
                    found above in parenthesis, the type of class or object expected, and a description of
                    the param (<code>item : Object</code> in the example).</li>
                <li><strong>Returns</strong> - If a class returns a value other than <code>undefined</code> a "Returns" section
                    will note the type of class or object returned and a description (<code>Ext.Component</code> in the
                    example)</li>
                <li><strong>Since</strong> (<em>not shown in the example</em>) - Some members will show which version of the
                    product the member was first introduced (i.e. <code>Available since 3.4.0</code> - <em>not pictured in
                        the example</em>) just after the member description</li>
                <li><strong>Default</strong> (<em>not shown in the example</em>) - Configs often show the default config value
                    to be applied to a class instance if not overridden (i.e. <code>Defaults to: false</code>)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="member-flags">Member Flags</h3>
            <p>The API documentation uses a number of flags to further commnicate the class member's
                function and intent.  The label may be represented by a text label, an abbreviation, or
                an icon.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Required</strong> - Required config when instantiating a class</li>
                <li><strong>Bindable</strong> - The config has a setter which allows this config to be set via ViewModel
                    binding</li>
                <li><strong>Read Only</strong> - The property may be read, but cannot be used to configure /
                    re-configure a class instance at runtime</li>
                <li><strong>Singleton</strong> - Singleton classes are instantiated immediately once defined and may not
                    be instantiated manually</li>
                <li><strong>Static</strong> - A static method or property is a method or property belonging to the class
                    itself, not an instance of the class</li>
                <li><strong>Chainable</strong> - Refers to methods that return the class instance back when called.<br>This enables chained method calls like: <code>classInstance.method1().method2().etc();</code></li>
                <li><strong>Deprecated</strong> - A class or member that is scheduled for removal in a future
                    framework version and is provided in the current version for backwards compatibility.<br>Deprecated classes and members will have a message directing you to the preferred class /
                    method going forward.</li>
                <li><strong>Removed</strong> - A removed class or member that exists in documentation only as a
                    reference for users upgrading between framework versions</li>
                <li><strong>Template</strong> - A method defined within a base class designed to be overridden by
                    subclasses</li>
                <li><strong>Abstract</strong> - A class or member may be be defined as abstract.  Abstract classes and
                    members establish a class structure and provide limited, if any, code.  Class-specific

            <h2 id="navigation-and-features">Navigation and Features</h2>
            <h3 id="class-member-quick-nav-menu">Class Member Quick-Nav Menu</h3>
            <p>Just below the class name on an API doc page is a row of buttons corresponding to the
                types of members owned by the current class.  Each button shows a count of members by
                type (this count is updated as filters are applied).  Clicking the button will navigate
                you to that member section.  Hovering over the member-type button will reveal a popup
                menu of all members of that type for quick navigation.</p>
            <h3 id="getter-and-setter-methods">Getter and Setter Methods</h3>
            <p>Getting and setter methods that correlate to a class config option will show up in the
                methods section as well as in the configs section of both the API doc and the member-type
                menus just beneath the config they work with.  The getter and setter method documentation
                will be found in the config row for easy reference.</p>
            <h3 id="history-bar">History Bar</h3>
            <p>Your page history is kept in localstorage and displayed (using the available real estate)
                just below the top title bar.  By default, the only search results shown are the pages
                matching the product / version you're currently viewing.  You can expand what is
                displayed by clicking on the <span class="icon-demo history-config"></span> button on the
                right-hand side of the history bar and choosing the "All" radio option.  This will show
                all recent pages in the history bar for all products / versions.</p>
            <p>Within the history config menu you will also see a listing of your recent page visits.
                The results are filtered by the "Current Product / Version" and "All" radio options.
                Clicking on the <span class="icon-demo history-clear"></span> button will clear the history bar as
                well as the history kept in local storage.</p>
            <p>If "All" is selected in the history config menu the checkbox option for "Show product
                details in the history bar" will be enabled.  When checked, the product/version for each
                historic page will show alongside the page name in the history bar.  Hovering the cursor
                over the page names in the history bar will also show the product/version as a tooltip.</p>
            <h3 id="search-and-filters">Search and Filters</h3>
            <p>Both API docs and guides can be searched for using the search field at the top of the
                page.</p>
            <p>On API doc pages there is also a filter input field that filters the member rows
                using the filter string.  In addition to filtering by string you can filter the class
                members by access level, inheritance, and read only.  This is done using the checkboxes at the top of
                the page.</p>
            <p>The checkbox at the bottom of the API class navigation tree filters the class list to
                include or exclude private classes.</p>
            <p>Clicking on an empty search field will show your last 10 searches for quick navigation.</p>
            <h3 id="api-doc-class-metadata">API Doc Class Metadata</h3>
            <p>Each API doc page (with the exception of Javascript primitives pages) has a menu view of
                metadata relating to that class.  This metadata view will have one or more of the
                following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alternate Name</strong> - One or more additional class name synonymns (in Ext JS 6.0.0 the
                    <code>Ext.button.Button</code> class has an alternate class name of <code>Ext.Button</code>).  Alternate class
                    names are commonly maintained for backward compatibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Hierarchy</strong> - The hierararchy view lists the inheritance chain of the current class
                    up through its ancestor classes up to the root base class.</li>
                <li><strong>Mixins</strong> - A list of classes that are mixed into the current class</li>
                <li><strong>Inherited Mixins</strong> - A list of classes that are mixed into an ancestor of the current
                    class</li>
                <li><strong>Requires</strong> - All classes required to be defined for the class to be instantiated</li>
                <li><strong>Uses</strong> - A list of classes potentially used by the class at some point in its
                    lifecycle, but not necessarily requried for the class to initially be instantiated</li>
                <li><strong>Subclasses</strong> - Classes that extend the current class</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="expanding-and-collapsing-examples-and-class-members">Expanding and Collapsing Examples and Class Members</h3>
            <p>Runnable examples (Fiddles) are expanded on a page by default.  You can collapse and
                expand example code blocks individually using the arrow on the top-left of the code
                block.  You can also toggle the collapse state of all examples using the toggle button on
                the top-right of the page.  The toggle-all state will be remembered between page loads.</p>
            <p>Class members are collapsed on a page by default.  You can expand and collapse members
                using the arrow icon on the left of the member row or globally using the expand /
                collapse all toggle button top-right.</p>
            <h3 id="desktop-vs-mobile-view">Desktop -vs- Mobile View</h3>
            <p>Viewing the docs on narrower screens or browsers will result in a view optimized for a
                smaller form factor.  The primary differences between the desktop and "mobile" view are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Global navigation will be located in a menu on the left-hand side accessible via the
                    hamburger menu icon.  The menu houses the following (on most pages):<ul>
                        <li>The name of the current product (as a link to the product landing page)</li>
                        <li>The Sencha icon used to navigate back to the documentation home page</li>
                        <li>The product menu drop-down button</li>
                        <li>Tabs of navigation trees for the API docs and guides</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Current context navigation and tools is located on the right-hand side accessible via
                    the gear icon.  The context menu houses teh following:<ul>
                        <li>The global search input field</li>
                        <li>(<em>API doc</em>) A "Filters" tab with the member filter, expand / collapse all examples
                            button, expand / collapse all member rows button, the access level filter checkboxes,
                            and the counts of each member</li>
                        <li>(<em>API doc</em>) A "Related Classes" tab containing the menu of metadata related to the
                            current class</li>
                        <li>(<em>Guides</em>) The table of contents for the guide</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="viewing-the-class-source">Viewing the Class Source</h3>
            <p>The class source can be viewed by clicking on the class name at the top of an API doc
                page.  The source for class members can be viewed by clicking on the "view source" link
                on the right-hand side of the member row.</p>

<p>Producing an application that is functional, usable, and beautiful across all devices is 
the holy grail of application development.  With Ext JS 6 you now have the tools you need 
to achieve this goal with minimal difficulty. </p>
<p>Creating an application that meets all of these requirements can be accomplished in a few 
different ways.  </p>
<h2 id="application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_universal_applications_and_toolkits">Universal Applications and Toolkits<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_universal_applications_and_toolkits"></a></h2>
<p>One of the biggest changes in Ext JS 6 is the merging of Ext JS and Touch into a single 
framework containing two distinct toolkits: classic and modern.  These toolkits contain 
the view layers from Ext JS and Touch.  Applications that share core resources and logic 
and utilize both toolkits are called Universal applications.</p>
<p>To select the application&#39;s toolkit, users simply adjust their Sencha Cmd generated 
application’s <code>app.json</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">&quot;toolkit&quot;: &quot;classic&quot;, // or &quot;modern&quot;
</code></pre><p>The core of both frameworks (data, controllers, models, etc) has been reconciled into a 
singular, common platform. This allows for shared data and logic, which can help developers 
optimize their applications even further.  </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: We&#39;ll talk about each toolkit in further detail below.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re not familiar with <code>app.json</code>, it&#39;s a list of configs that is the core of 
your application.  </p>
<p>The <code>app.json</code> file generated by Sencha Cmd contains many properties that you may want 
to adjust. These properties are documented inline to explain what they each control.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading a project, your app.json may not contain all of the possible options. 
After performing the upgrade, the default values for any missing properties can instead be 
found in &quot;.sencha/app/app.defaults.json&quot;. You should not edit that file, but can copy 
pieces from it to your <code>app.json</code> file.</p>
<p>For more information about <code>app.json</code>, please check out <a href="../../../../cmd/guides/microloader.html">the microloader guide</a>.</p>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_classic">Classic<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_classic"></a></h3>
<p>The classic toolkit provides traditional Ext JS 5 application support.  This includes 
support for the desktop browsers, tablets, and touchscreen enabled laptops.</p>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_modern">Modern<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_modern"></a></h3>
<p>The modern toolkit provides universal HTML5 application support all modern browsers (IE11+) 
from desktop to phone.</p>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_build_profiles">Build Profiles<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_build_profiles"></a></h3>
<p>Build profiles allow developers to create variations of an application based on the <code>builds</code> 
object found in an application&#39;s <code>app.json</code> file.  Historically, users have had the 
opportunity to differentiate builds based on theme and locale.</p>
<p>We talked more about <code>app.json</code> above, but for more information, please check out 
<a href="../../../../cmd/guides/microloader.html">the microloader guide</a>.</p>
<p>As of Ext JS 6 and Sencha Cmd 6, developers may now include a <code>toolkit</code> key within their 
build configs.  This allows users to set the toolkit to classic or modern (more below).  Cmd 
then loops through each build key and applies the appropriate toolkit and any toolkit 
agnostic logic for each build.  </p>
<p>Toolkit agnostic code includes anything that can be shared between toolkits.  This includes 
anything previously found within the sencha-core package (i.e., data, controllers, etc).<br>It&#39;s important to note that this shared logic must be usable by both toolkits.  </p>
<p>A <code>builds</code> config for a Universal application should look similar to the following 
JSON structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">&quot;builds&quot;: {

<p>Let&#39;s talk about the outcome you would expect based on the <code>builds</code> object above.  This <code>builds</code> 
config allows you to issue the following build commands from Sencha Cmd:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Build modern application only
sencha app build mymodern

// Build classic application only
sencha app build myclassic 

// Build all targets within the builds object
sencha app build 
</code></pre><p>It&#39;s important to note that the build target names can be anything you choose.  You could 
replace <code>mymodern</code> with <code>foo</code>, and then issue:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">sencha app build foo
</code></pre><p>The resulting <code>mymodern</code> application would use the modern toolkit, have access to the ux 
and charts package, and display the Cupertino theme.  </p>
<p>The resulting <code>myclassic</code> application would use the classic toolkit, have access to the 
charts package, and display the Neptune theme.</p>
<p>You can create as many variations within the <code>builds</code> object as you like.  All output will 
show up in your root level builds folder by default.</p>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_universal_applications">Universal Applications<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_universal_applications"></a></h3>
<p>Universal applications utilize Sencha Cmd to produce multiple application builds spanning 
both toolkits.  These builds result in applications that may be run on Desktop or 
Mobile devices.  It&#39;s important to note that a single application <strong>cannot</strong> include 
modern and classic frameworks in a single classpath.  In most cases, an application will 
contain global logic in the traditional application directory; the root level ’app’ folder.<br>Ideally, the Universal aspect of the your application will contain data, models, 
viewmodels, etc.  You can also share controllers, though, developers may need to be 
creative in order to produce logic that can span toolkits.  </p>
<p>For instance, let&#39;s assume your classic application has a grid, and your modern application 
has a list, and they both consume a shared store and model.  Then, let&#39;s say that you&#39;d 
like both applications to react to user interaction with these components.  We must look 
for common events between the grid and the list.  An ideal solution may be to utilize the 
select event, since both components are able to fire it.  However, if your logic included 
&quot;itemtap&quot;, your classic application would not know what that meant, and it would most likely 
cause issues during the classic portion of the Cmd build process.</p>
<p>After considering shared logic and resources, developers can then create toolkit specific 
code within the appropriate toolkit src folder.  This is best understood by viewing the 
new Universal application folder structure in Ext JS 6.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Folder structure should look quite similar to past implementations if you are 
creating a single toolkit application.</p>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_ext_js_6_folder_structure">Ext JS 6 Folder Structure<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_ext_js_6_folder_structure"></a></h3>
<p>It&#39;s important to note some significant differences in Ext JS 6 and Sencha Cmd 6&#39;s new 
directory structure when creating a Universal application.  These changes were made in 
order to ensure applications were able to target three specific areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Global Application Code</p>
</li>
<li><p>Classic Specific Code</p>
</li>
<li><p>Modern Specific Code</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#39;s a representation of a Universal app folder structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// app

     // app

          // model

          // store    

          // view

     // classic

          // src

          // sass

          // resources

     // modern

          // src

          // sass

          // resources

     // resources

     // sass

<p>It&#39;s simple to get started with a Universal application.  Sencha Cmd now produces a 
&quot;starter app&quot; that contains the appropriate file structure, <code>app.json</code>, and examples of 
shared code.  To create your Universal application, generate an application as per usual:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"> sencha -sdk /path/to/ExtSDK generate app MyApp ./MyAppLocation
</code></pre><p>Sencha Cmd will now create a fully functional Universal application.  This application 
will produce a classic and modern application that both share data that can be found in 
the &quot;app&quot; folder.  Toolkit specific definitions may be found in their respective toolkit 
named folders (modern and classic).</p>
<p>In order to see each application for development, you can target your sencha app watch 
in the same manner as you target your builds.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"> sencha app watch modern 

 sencha app watch classic
</code></pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> Omitting a watch target will default to the first named build in the <code>builds</code> object.</p>
<p>Once you&#39;ve built your application, you can view the builds in their respective browsers.<br>For instance, loading the build folder on an iPhone should show you the modern version of 
your application.  Loading it in a desktop browser should show you the classic version 
of your application.</p>
<h2 id="application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_runtime_configurations">Runtime Configurations<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_runtime_configurations"></a></h2>
<p>There are also several ways to use an application’s runtime environment to create 
applications.  These methods include app profile, responsive configs, and platform configs.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s explore the possibilities each of them presents and how they can work together to 
provide your users with a seamless experience across many mediums.</p>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_app_profiles">App Profiles<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_app_profiles"></a></h3>
<p>Using <code>Ext.app.Profile</code> allows developers to swap out an application&#39;s view based on a defined 
criteria via the mainView (or Viewport). This means you can create an entirely different 
view for your application by activating a profile for specific conditions.  For instance, 
you may want to present specific views depending on whether your application is being loaded 
on a Mobile device -vs- a Desktop browser.   </p>
<p>In this case, you would create two profiles and then list them in your profiles array 
found on the Application class.  Here&#39;s a simple example of 
such a setup:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Ext.define(&#39;App.Application&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.Application&#39;,

    profiles: [
        &#39;Desktop&#39;,
        &#39;Mobile&#39;
    ]
});
</code></pre><p>The active profile is determined by the returned value of the <code>isActive</code>
method on your profile.  Here&#39;s an example of how you could configure an application to 
load the desktop view based on the detected OS.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Ext.define(&#39;App.profile.Desktop&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.Profile&#39;,

    mainView: &#39;App.view.desktop.Main&#39;,

    isActive: function () {
        return Ext.os.is.Desktop;
    },

    launch: function () {
        console.log(&#39;Launch Desktop&#39;);
    }
});
</code></pre><p>Profiles do not have to use the <code>mainView</code> config.  Instead, you could use the profile&#39;s 
launch method for any further custom processing. Only the active profile’s <code>launch</code> method 
will be called.</p>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_platform_configs">Platform Configs<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_platform_configs"></a></h3>
<p>The <code>platformConfig</code> property can be used in class 
declarations or to configure object instances based on the current platform or device 
classification. We might use this in a view like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Ext.define(&#39;App.view.summary.Manufacturing&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,

    title: &#39;Mfg Summary&#39;,

    platformConfig: {
        desktop: {
            title: &#39;Manufacturing Summary&#39;
        }
    }
});
</code></pre><p>The above has the same result as the direct approach below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Ext.define(&#39;App.view.summary.Manufacturing&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,

    title: testForDesktop ? &#39;Manufacturing Summary&#39;
                          : &#39;Mfg Summary&#39;
});
</code></pre><p>The idea is not to compare the merits of <code>platformConfig</code> versus a ternary operator, 
but rather to see that <code>platformConfig</code> is treated as part of the class declaration. As 
such, this approach will work regardless of the base class. One reason to prefer 
<code>platformConfig</code> over inline logic is to keep a view as data-only which can be safely sent 
in JSON format.</p>
<p>One can also use <code>platformConfig</code> to configure instances:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Ext.define(&#39;App.view.summary.Manufacturing&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,

    items: [{
        xtype: &#39;panel&#39;,

        platformConfig: {
            desktop: {
                title: &#39;Manufacturing Summary&#39;
            },
            &#39;!desktop&#39;: {
                title: &#39;Mfg Summary&#39;
            }
        }
    }]
});
</code></pre><p>The best direct translation of the above would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Ext.define(&#39;App.view.summary.Manufacturing&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,

    items: [
        Ext.merge({
            xtype: &#39;panel&#39;
        },
        testForDesktop ? {
            title: &#39;Manufacturing Summary&#39;
        } : {
            title: &#39;Mfg Summary&#39;
        })
    ]
});
</code></pre><p>In this use of platformConfig, however, the merging is handled by the <code>initConfig</code> 
method. In other words, providing a <code>platformConfig</code> property as an instance configuration 
is only supported for classes that call <code>initConfig</code> in their constructor. This is the case 
for <code>Ext.Widget</code>, <code>Ext.Component</code>, most of the data package classes 
(such as AbstractStore), and any class that uses Observable.</p>
<p>Similar to how using <code>platformConfig</code> in a class declaration modifies the class body, using 
<code>platformConfig</code> on an instance config modifies the initial configuration of the object.</p>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_responsive_configs">Responsive Configs<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_responsive_configs"></a></h3>
<p>Ext JS 5.0 introduced the <code>responsiveConfig</code> and the Responsive Mixin 
and plugin that enables it. <code>responsiveConfig&#39;s</code> rules and 
properties are not only evaluated when creating instances, but when device orientation or 
viewport size changes. While this adds some overhead compared to <code>platformConfig</code>, it is 
likely to be more efficient than handling these yourself by listening to window resize or 
orientation change.</p>
<p>If we adjust our criteria slightly, we can make the title respond to device size instead 
of device classification (&quot;desktop&quot;).</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Ext.define(&#39;App.view.summary.Manufacturing&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,
    mixins: [&#39;Ext.mixin.Responsive&#39;],

    responsiveConfig: {
        &#39;width &gt;= 600&#39;: {
            title: &#39;Manufacturing Summary&#39;
        },
        &#39;width &lt; 600&#39;: {
            title: &#39;Mfg Summary&#39;
        }
    }
});
</code></pre><p>Because the above class has a <code>responsiveConfig</code>, we benefit from using the mixin here and 
avoid creating a plugin for each instance. When used on a component instance, however, 
we must use the responsive plugin instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Ext.define(&#39;App.view.summary.Manufacturing&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,

    items: [{
        xtype: &#39;panel&#39;,
        plugins: &#39;responsive&#39;,

        responsiveConfig: {
            &#39;width &gt;= 600&#39;: {
                title: &#39;Manufacturing Summary&#39;
            },
            &#39;width &lt; 600&#39;: {
                title: &#39;Mfg Summary&#39;
            }
        }
    }]
});
</code></pre><p>It is important to remember that width in the above example is viewport width, not 
component width.</p>
<h2 id="application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_conclusion">Conclusion<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-developing_for_multiple_screens_and_environments_-_conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>With all these tools at hand, it is just a matter of picking the right tool for the particular 
situation. For simple tuning at load time, there is <code>platformConfig</code>. For more dynamic 
conditions, there is <code>responsiveConfig</code>. To change things on a larger scale, there is 
<code>Ext.app.Profile</code>.</p>
<p>And if you need an application that looks completely different on tablets than it does on 
desktop, or even phones, you could consider Sencha Cmd build profiles. Build profiles can 
remove the tablet overhead from the desktop build and vice versa.</p>
<p>Since there cannot be a &quot;one size fits all&quot; solution, Ext JS provides different tools that 
combine efficiency and flexibility. They each work together to help ensure that your 
application will be a natural fit for the widest possible range of devices.</p>
