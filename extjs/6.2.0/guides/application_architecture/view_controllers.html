            <p>Many classes have shortcut names used when creating (instantiating) a class with a
                configuration object.  The shortcut name is referred to as an <code>alias</code> (or <code>xtype</code> if the
                class extends Ext.Component).  The alias/xtype is listed next to the class name of
                applicable classes for quick reference.</p>
            <h3 id="access-levels">Access Levels</h3>
            <p>Framework classes or their members may be specified as <code>private</code> or <code>protected</code>.  Else,
                the class / member is <code>public</code>.  <code>Public</code>, <code>protected</code>, and <code>private</code> are access
                descriptors used to convey how and when the class or class member should be used.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Public</strong> classes and class members are available for use by any other class or
                    application code and may be relied upon as a stable and persistent within major product
                    versions.  Public classes and members may safely be extended via a subclass.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Protected</strong> class members are stable <code>public</code> members intended to be used by the
                    owning class or its subclasses.  Protected members may safely be extended via a subclass.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Private</strong> classes and class members are used internally by the framework and are not
                    intended to be used by application developers.  Private classes and members may change or
                    be omitted from the framework at any time without notice and should not be relied upon in
                    application logic.</p>

            </ul>
            <h3 id="member-types">Member Types</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Config</strong> - The configuration options for a class.</li>
                <li><strong>Property</strong> - Set once a class is instantiated. *See Read Only below.</li>
                <li><strong>Method</strong> - Actions that can be performed by a class.  Methods should be read as
                    instance methods and can only be called from a instance of a given class.  Static methods
                    that can be called directly from the class itself will have a <code>static</code> label next to the
                    method name.  *See Static below.</li>
                <li><strong>Event</strong> - Events are specific to the framework event system allowing for classes to
                    programmatically raise an event to be handled by one or more event handler methods.  DOM
                    events, while handled by the framework event system, are not specifically described
                    within the API documentation.  *For DOM events refer to the
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events">event reference</a> page from MDN.</li>
                <li><strong>Theme Variable</strong> - Variables used by the visual theme engine employed by the
                    framework.</li>
                <li><strong>Theme Mixin</strong> - Functions used by the visual theme engine employed by the framework
                    and may use values set in various Theme Variables.</li>

            <h3 id="member-syntax">Member Syntax</h3>
            <p>Below is an example class member that we can disect to show the syntax of a class member
                (the lookupComponent method as viewed from the Ext.button.Button class in this case).</p>
            <div style="position: relative;" class="show-inherited show-protected members">
                <div style="border: 1px solid #E4E4E4;" class="classmembers member-protected isNotStatic isInherited member-expanded" data-member-name="lookupComponent">

                    </div>
                    <div class="source-class"><a href="javascript:void(0);">Ext.container.Container</a><div class="viewSource"><a href="javascript:void(0);"></a><a target="_blank" href="javascript:void(0);">view source</a></div></div>
                    <div class="member-header">
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="member-name-link"><span data-ref="method-lookupComponent" class="member-name"><strong>lookup</strong>Component</span></a>
                        <span class="params-list"> ( item )</span> : <span class="memberType">Ext.Component</span>
                        <div class="member-tags"><span class="protected">protected</span></div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Called when a raw config object is added to this container either during initialization of the <a href="javascript:void(0);">items</a> config,
                        or when new items are <a href="javascript:void(0);">added), or {@link #insert inserted</a>.</p>
                    <p>This method converts the passed object into an instanced child component.</p>
                    <p>This may be overridden in subclasses when special processing needs to be applied to child creation.</p>
                    <div class="detail-header">Parameters</div>
                    <p><span class="params-list">item</span> :

                    <div class="params-desc"><p>The config object being added.</p></div>
                    <div class="detail-header">Returns</div>
                    <span style="margin-left:12px;" class="memberType">Ext.Component</span>

            </div>
    
            <p>Let's look at each part of the member row:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Expand/Collapse</strong> - On the left-hand size of the member row is a control used to
                    expand and collapse each member row to show / hide member details.</li>
                <li><strong>Member Name</strong> - The name of the class member (<code>lookupComponent</code> in this example)</li>
                <li><strong>Method Param</strong> - Any required or optional params used by a method (or passed to an
                    event handler method) will be listed next to the method name within parenthesis
                    (<code>( item )</code> in this example)</li>
                <li><strong>Return type</strong> - The class instance or javascript object returned by the method or
                    property (<code>Ext.Component</code> in this case).  This may be omitted for methods that do not
                    return anything other than <code>undefined</code> or may display as multiple possible values
                    separated by a forward slash <code>/</code> signifying that what is returned may depend on the
                    results of the method call (i.e. a method may return a Component if a get method calls is
                    successful or <code>false</code> if unsuccessful which would be displayed as
                    <code>Ext.Component/Boolean</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Flags</strong> - Any flags applicable to the member will be displayed next (<code>PROTECTED</code> in
                    this example - see the Flags section below)</li>
                <li><strong>Member Origin</strong> - On the right-hand side of the member row is the class where the
                    member was initially described (<code>Ext.container.Container</code> in this example).  The source
                    class will be displayed as a blue link if the member originates from the current class
                    and gray if it is inherited from an ancestor or mixed-in class.</li>
                <li><strong>Member Source</strong> - On the right-hand side below the member origin class is a link to
                    view the member's source (<code>view source</code> in the example)</li>
                <li><strong>Params List</strong> - Each param for a class method will be listed using the same name
                    found above in parenthesis, the type of class or object expected, and a description of
                    the param (<code>item : Object</code> in the example).</li>
                <li><strong>Returns</strong> - If a class returns a value other than <code>undefined</code> a "Returns" section
                    will note the type of class or object returned and a description (<code>Ext.Component</code> in the
                    example)</li>
                <li><strong>Since</strong> (<em>not shown in the example</em>) - Some members will show which version of the
                    product the member was first introduced (i.e. <code>Available since 3.4.0</code> - <em>not pictured in
                        the example</em>) just after the member description</li>
                <li><strong>Default</strong> (<em>not shown in the example</em>) - Configs often show the default config value
                    to be applied to a class instance if not overridden (i.e. <code>Defaults to: false</code>)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="member-flags">Member Flags</h3>
            <p>The API documentation uses a number of flags to further commnicate the class member's
                function and intent.  The label may be represented by a text label, an abbreviation, or
                an icon.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Required</strong> - Required config when instantiating a class</li>
                <li><strong>Bindable</strong> - The config has a setter which allows this config to be set via ViewModel
                    binding</li>
                <li><strong>Read Only</strong> - The property may be read, but cannot be used to configure /
                    re-configure a class instance at runtime</li>
                <li><strong>Singleton</strong> - Singleton classes are instantiated immediately once defined and may not
                    be instantiated manually</li>
                <li><strong>Static</strong> - A static method or property is a method or property belonging to the class
                    itself, not an instance of the class</li>
                <li><strong>Chainable</strong> - Refers to methods that return the class instance back when called.<br>This enables chained method calls like: <code>classInstance.method1().method2().etc();</code></li>
                <li><strong>Deprecated</strong> - A class or member that is scheduled for removal in a future
                    framework version and is provided in the current version for backwards compatibility.<br>Deprecated classes and members will have a message directing you to the preferred class /
                    method going forward.</li>
                <li><strong>Removed</strong> - A removed class or member that exists in documentation only as a
                    reference for users upgrading between framework versions</li>
                <li><strong>Template</strong> - A method defined within a base class designed to be overridden by
                    subclasses</li>
                <li><strong>Abstract</strong> - A class or member may be be defined as abstract.  Abstract classes and
                    members establish a class structure and provide limited, if any, code.  Class-specific
                    code will be furnished via overrides in subclasses.</li>

            <h2 id="navigation-and-features">Navigation and Features</h2>
            <h3 id="class-member-quick-nav-menu">Class Member Quick-Nav Menu</h3>
            <p>Just below the class name on an API doc page is a row of buttons corresponding to the
                types of members owned by the current class.  Each button shows a count of members by
                type (this count is updated as filters are applied).  Clicking the button will navigate
                you to that member section.  Hovering over the member-type button will reveal a popup
                menu of all members of that type for quick navigation.</p>
            <h3 id="getter-and-setter-methods">Getter and Setter Methods</h3>
            <p>Getting and setter methods that correlate to a class config option will show up in the
                methods section as well as in the configs section of both the API doc and the member-type
                menus just beneath the config they work with.  The getter and setter method documentation
                will be found in the config row for easy reference.</p>
            <h3 id="history-bar">History Bar</h3>
            <p>Your page history is kept in localstorage and displayed (using the available real estate)
                just below the top title bar.  By default, the only search results shown are the pages
                matching the product / version you're currently viewing.  You can expand what is
                displayed by clicking on the <span class="icon-demo history-config"></span> button on the
                right-hand side of the history bar and choosing the "All" radio option.  This will show
                all recent pages in the history bar for all products / versions.</p>
            <p>Within the history config menu you will also see a listing of your recent page visits.
                The results are filtered by the "Current Product / Version" and "All" radio options.
                Clicking on the <span class="icon-demo history-clear"></span> button will clear the history bar as
                well as the history kept in local storage.</p>
            <p>If "All" is selected in the history config menu the checkbox option for "Show product
                details in the history bar" will be enabled.  When checked, the product/version for each
                historic page will show alongside the page name in the history bar.  Hovering the cursor
                over the page names in the history bar will also show the product/version as a tooltip.</p>
            <h3 id="search-and-filters">Search and Filters</h3>
            <p>Both API docs and guides can be searched for using the search field at the top of the
                page.</p>
            <p>On API doc pages there is also a filter input field that filters the member rows
                using the filter string.  In addition to filtering by string you can filter the class
                members by access level, inheritance, and read only.  This is done using the checkboxes at the top of
                the page.</p>
            <p>The checkbox at the bottom of the API class navigation tree filters the class list to
                include or exclude private classes.</p>
            <p>Clicking on an empty search field will show your last 10 searches for quick navigation.</p>
            <h3 id="api-doc-class-metadata">API Doc Class Metadata</h3>
            <p>Each API doc page (with the exception of Javascript primitives pages) has a menu view of
                metadata relating to that class.  This metadata view will have one or more of the
                following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alternate Name</strong> - One or more additional class name synonymns (in Ext JS 6.0.0 the
                    <code>Ext.button.Button</code> class has an alternate class name of <code>Ext.Button</code>).  Alternate class
                    names are commonly maintained for backward compatibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Hierarchy</strong> - The hierararchy view lists the inheritance chain of the current class
                    up through its ancestor classes up to the root base class.</li>
                <li><strong>Mixins</strong> - A list of classes that are mixed into the current class</li>
                <li><strong>Inherited Mixins</strong> - A list of classes that are mixed into an ancestor of the current
                    class</li>
                <li><strong>Requires</strong> - All classes required to be defined for the class to be instantiated</li>
                <li><strong>Uses</strong> - A list of classes potentially used by the class at some point in its
                    lifecycle, but not necessarily requried for the class to initially be instantiated</li>
                <li><strong>Subclasses</strong> - Classes that extend the current class</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="expanding-and-collapsing-examples-and-class-members">Expanding and Collapsing Examples and Class Members</h3>
            <p>Runnable examples (Fiddles) are expanded on a page by default.  You can collapse and
                expand example code blocks individually using the arrow on the top-left of the code
                block.  You can also toggle the collapse state of all examples using the toggle button on
                the top-right of the page.  The toggle-all state will be remembered between page loads.</p>
            <p>Class members are collapsed on a page by default.  You can expand and collapse members
                using the arrow icon on the left of the member row or globally using the expand /
                collapse all toggle button top-right.</p>
            <h3 id="desktop-vs-mobile-view">Desktop -vs- Mobile View</h3>
            <p>Viewing the docs on narrower screens or browsers will result in a view optimized for a
                smaller form factor.  The primary differences between the desktop and "mobile" view are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Global navigation will be located in a menu on the left-hand side accessible via the
                    hamburger menu icon.  The menu houses the following (on most pages):<ul>
                        <li>The name of the current product (as a link to the product landing page)</li>
                        <li>The Sencha icon used to navigate back to the documentation home page</li>
                        <li>The product menu drop-down button</li>
                        <li>Tabs of navigation trees for the API docs and guides</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Current context navigation and tools is located on the right-hand side accessible via
                    the gear icon.  The context menu houses teh following:<ul>
                        <li>The global search input field</li>
                        <li>(<em>API doc</em>) A "Filters" tab with the member filter, expand / collapse all examples
                            button, expand / collapse all member rows button, the access level filter checkboxes,
                            and the counts of each member</li>
                        <li>(<em>API doc</em>) A "Related Classes" tab containing the menu of metadata related to the
                            current class</li>
                        <li>(<em>Guides</em>) The table of contents for the guide</li>

<p>Ext JS delivers some exciting improvements for you to use in your application 
architecture. We have added support for ViewModels and MVVM as well as ViewControllers 
to enhance MVC applications. Best of all, these choices are not mutually exclusive, so 
you can introduce these features incrementally or even blend them.</p>
<h2 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_application_level_controllers">Application-level Controllers<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_application_level_controllers"></a></h2>
<p>A Controller is a class derived from <a href="../../../../extjs/6.2.0/modern/Ext.app.Controller.html">Ext.app.Controller</a>. These Controllers use 
CSS-like selectors (called “Component Queries”) to match components and respond to their 
events. They also use “refs” to select and retrieve component instances.</p>
<p>These controllers are created at application launch and remain present for the life of 
the application. During its lifetime, views of interest to a controller will come and go. 
There may even be multiple instances of views that the controller manages.</p>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_challenges">Challenges<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_challenges"></a></h3>
<p>For large applications, these techniques can create certain challenges.</p>
<p>In such environments, views and controllers may be authored by multiple development 
teams and integrated into the final application. Ensuring that controllers only react to 
their intended views can be difficult. Further, it is common for developers to want to 
limit the number of controllers created at application launch. While lazily creating 
controllers is possible with some effort, they can’t be destroyed, so they remain even 
if they are no longer needed.</p>
<h2 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_viewcontrollers">ViewControllers<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_viewcontrollers"></a></h2>
<p>While Ext JS 5+ is backwards compatible with legacy application-level controllers, it 
introduces a new type of controller designed to handle these challenges: 
<a href="../../../../extjs/6.2.0/modern/Ext.app.ViewController.html">Ext.app.ViewController</a>. ViewController does this in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplifies the connection to views using “listeners” and “reference” configs.</li>
<li>Leverages the life cycle of views to automatically manage their associated 
ViewController.</li>
<li>Reduces complexity in the ViewController based on a one-to-one relationship with the 
managed view.</li>
<li>Provides encapsulation to make nesting views reliable.</li>
<li>Retains the ability to select components and listen to their events at any level below 
the associated view.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_listeners">Listeners<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_listeners"></a></h3>
<p>For the purposes of ViewControllers, we can look at just two examples. The first is a 
basic use of a listeners config on a child item in a view:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.Foo&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,
    xtype: &#39;foo&#39;,
    controller: &#39;foo&#39;,

    items: [{
        xtype: &#39;textfield&#39;,
        fieldLabel: &#39;Bar&#39;,
        listeners: {
            change: &#39;onBarChange&#39;  // no scope given here
        }
    }]
});

Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.FooController&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.ViewController&#39;,
    alias: &#39;controller.foo&#39;,

    onBarChange: function (barTextField) {
        // called by &#39;change&#39; event
    }
});
</code></pre><p>The above use of listeners shows a named event handler (<code>onBarChange</code>) with no specified 
“scope”. Internally, the event system resolves the default scope for the Bar textfield 
to its owning ViewController.</p>
<p>Historically, the listeners config was reserved for use by a component’s creator, so how 
would a view listen to its own events, or perhaps those fired by its base class? The 
answer is that we need to use an explicit scope:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.Foo&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,
    xtype: &#39;foo&#39;,
    controller: &#39;foo&#39;,

    listeners: {
        collapse: &#39;onCollapse&#39;,
        scope: &#39;controller&#39;
    },

    items: [{
        ...
    }]
});
</code></pre><p>The above example leverages two new features in Ext JS: named scopes and declarative 
listeners. We’ll focus on the named scope here. There are two valid values for named 
scope: “this” and “controller”. When writing MVC applications, we almost always use 
“controller” which has the obvious result of looking on that view’s ViewController (not 
the ViewController of the view that created the instance).</p>
<p>Since a view is a type of <a href="../../../../extjs/6.2.0/modern/Ext.Component.html">Ext.Component</a>, we have assigned this view an “xtype” 
which enables other views to create an instance of our view in the same way this view 
created its textfield. To see how this comes together, consider a view that uses this 
one. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.bar.Bar&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,
    xtype: &#39;bar&#39;,
    controller: &#39;bar&#39;,

    items: [{
        xtype: &#39;foo&#39;,
        listeners: {
            collapse: &#39;onCollapse&#39;
        }
    }]
});
</code></pre><p>In this case, the Bar view is creating an instance of the Foo view as one of its items. 
Further, it is listening to the collapse event just like the Foo view. The listeners 
declared by the Foo view will fire on Foo’s ViewController while the listeners declared 
in the Bar view will fire on Bar’s ViewController.</p>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_reference">Reference<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_reference"></a></h3>
<p>One of the most common loose ends when writing controller logic is getting ahold of the 
necessary components to complete a particular action. Something as simple as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.Foo&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,
    xtype: &#39;foo&#39;,
    controller: &#39;foo&#39;,

    tbar: [{
        xtype: &#39;button&#39;,
        text: &#39;Add&#39;,
        handler: &#39;onAdd&#39;
    }],

    items: [{
        xtype: &#39;grid&#39;,
        ...
    }]
});

Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.FooController&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.ViewController&#39;,
    alias: &#39;controller.foo&#39;,

    onAdd: function () {
        // ... get the grid and add a record ...
    }
});
</code></pre><p>But how should one acquire the grid component? All techniques require you to place some 
recognizable property on the grid to allow it to be uniquely identified. Older 
techniques used the “id” config (and <a href="../../../../extjs/6.2.0/modern/Ext.html#method-getCmp">getCmp</a>) or the “itemId” config (using 
“refs” or some component query method). The advantage of “id” is fast lookup, but since 
these identifiers must be unique across the entire application and the DOM as well, this 
is not often desirable. Using “itemId” and some form of query is more flexible, but it’s 
necessary to perform a search to find the desired component.</p>
<p>Using the <code>reference</code> config, we simply add the “reference” to the grid and use 
<code>lookupReference</code> to get at it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.Foo&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,
    xtype: &#39;foo&#39;,
    controller: &#39;foo&#39;,

    tbar: [{
        xtype: &#39;button&#39;,
        text: &#39;Add&#39;,
        handler: &#39;onAdd&#39;
    }],

    items: [{
        xtype: &#39;grid&#39;,
        reference: &#39;fooGrid&#39;
        ...
    }]
});

Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.FooController&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.ViewController&#39;,
    alias: &#39;controller.foo&#39;,

    onAdd: function () {
        var grid = this.lookupReference(&#39;fooGrid&#39;);
    }
});
</code></pre><p>This is similar to assigning an itemId of “fooGrid” and doing: “this.down(‘#fooGrid’)”. 
The difference under the hood, however, is quite significant. First, a reference config 
instructs the component to register itself with its owning view (identified by the 
presence of a ViewController in this case). Second, the <code>lookupReference</code> method simply 
consults the cache to see if references need to be refreshed (say due to add or remove 
on a container). If all is well, it just returns the reference from the cache. Or, 
in pseudo-code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">lookupReference: (reference) {
    var cache = this.references;
    if (!cache) {
        Ext.fixReferences(); // fix all references
        cache = this.references; // now the cache is valid
    }
    return cache[reference];
}
</code></pre><p>In other words, there is no search and the linkages damaged by adding or removing items 
from containers are fixed in one go, when they are needed. As we will see below, this 
approach has benefits other than efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_encapsulation">Encapsulation<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_encapsulation"></a></h3>
<p>The use of selectors along with the controller <code>refs</code> config was very flexible, but at 
the same time had certain risks. The fact that these selectors “see” everything at all 
levels of the component hierarchy is both powerful and prone to mistakes. For example, a 
controller could be working 100% when it runs in isolation but then fails as soon as 
other views are introduced because its selectors have undesired matches with the new 
view.</p>
<p>These problems can be managed by following certain practices, but when using listeners 
and references with a ViewController these problems are simply not possible. This is 
because the listeners and reference configs connect only with their owning 
ViewController. Views are free to chose any reference value that is unique within that 
view knowing that these names will not be exposed to the view’s creator.</p>
<p>Likewise, listeners are resolved on their owning ViewController and cannot be 
accidentally dispatched to event handlers in other controllers with errant selectors. 
While listeners are often preferable to selectors, the two mechanisms play well together 
for those situations where a selector-based approach is desired.</p>
<p>To complete this model, views need to fire events that can be consumed by their owning 
view’s ViewController. There is a helper method in ViewController for this purpose: 
<code>fireViewEvent</code>. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.FooController&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.ViewController&#39;,
    alias: &#39;controller.foo&#39;,

    onAdd: function () {
        var record = new MyApp.model.Thing();
        var grid = this.lookupReference(&#39;fooGrid&#39;);
        grid.store.add(record);

        this.fireViewEvent(&#39;addrecord&#39;, this, record);
    }
});
</code></pre><p>This enables the standard form of listener for the creator of this view:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.bar.Bar&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.panel.Panel&#39;,
    xtype: &#39;bar&#39;,
    controller: &#39;bar&#39;,

    items: [{
        xtype: &#39;foo&#39;,
        listeners: {
            collapse: &#39;onCollapse&#39;,
            addrecord: &#39;onAddRecord&#39;
        }
    }]
});
</code></pre><h3 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_listeners_and_event_domains">Listeners and Event Domains<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_listeners_and_event_domains"></a></h3>
<p>In Ext JS 4.2, the MVC event dispatcher was generalized with the introduction of event 
domains. These event domains intercepted events as they were fired and dispatched them 
to controllers controlled by selector matching. The “component” event domain had full 
component query selectors while the other domains had more limited selectors.</p>
<p>With Ext JS 5+, each ViewController creates an instance of a new type of event domain 
called the “view” event domain. This event domain allows ViewControllers to use the 
standard <code>listen</code> and <code>control</code> methods while limiting their scope implicitly to their 
view. It also adds a special selector to match the view itself:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Ext.define(&#39;MyApp.view.foo.FooController&#39;, {
    extend: &#39;Ext.app.ViewController&#39;,
    alias: &#39;controller.foo&#39;,

    control: {
        &#39;#&#39;: {  // matches the view itself
            collapse: &#39;onCollapse&#39;
        },
        button: {
            click: &#39;onAnyButtonClick&#39;
        }
    }
});
</code></pre><p>The key difference between listeners and selectors can be seen above. The “button” 
selector will match any button in this view or any child view, irrespective of depth, 
even if that button belongs to a great-grandchild view. In other words, selector-based 
handlers do not respect encapsulation boundaries. This behavior is consistent with 
previous <a href="../../../../extjs/6.2.0/modern/Ext.app.Controller.html">Ext.app.Controller</a> behavior and can be a useful technique in limited 
situations.</p>
<p>Lastly, these event domains respect nesting and effectively “bubble” an event up the 
view hierarchy. That is to say, when an event fires, it’s first delivered to any 
standard listeners. Then, it’s delivered to its owning ViewController, followed by its 
parent ViewController (if any) on up the hierarchy. Eventually, the event is delivered 
to the standard “component” event domain to be handled by Ext.app.Controller-derived 
controllers.</p>
<h3 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_life_cycle">Life cycle<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_life_cycle"></a></h3>
<p>A common technique with large applications is to dynamically create controllers when 
they are first needed. This could help reduce the load time of the application and help 
runtime performance as well by not activating all potential controllers. The limitation 
to this in previous versions was that, once created, these controllers would remain 
active in the application. It was not possible to destroy them and release their 
resources. Likewise, this did not change the reality that a controller could have any 
number of associated views (including none).</p>
<p>The ViewController, however, is created very early in the component’s lifecycle and is 
bound to that view for its entire lifetime. When that view is destroyed, the 
ViewController is likewise destroyed. This means that the ViewController is no longer 
forced to manage states where there is no view or many views.</p>
<p>This one-to-one relationship means reference tracking is simplified and no longer prone 
to leaking destroyed components. A ViewController can implement any of these methods to 
perform tasks at key points in its lifecycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>beforeInit - This method can be overridden in order to operate on the view prior to 
its initComponent method being called. This method is called immediately after the 
controller is created, which occurs during initConfig called from the Component 
constructor.</li>
<li>init - Called shortly after initComponent has been called on the view. This is the 
typical time to perform initialization for the controller now that the view is 
initialized.</li>
<li>initViewModel - Called when the view’s ViewModel is created (if one is defined).</li>
<li>destroy - Cleanup and return resources (be sure to call <code>callParent</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_conclusion">Conclusion<a class="quick-link" href="#application_architecture-_-view_controllers_-_conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>We think ViewControllers will greatly streamline your MVC applications. They also work 
very well with ViewModels, so you can combine these approaches and their respective 
strengths. We’re excited about the upcoming release and seeing these improvements at 
work in your applications.</p>
