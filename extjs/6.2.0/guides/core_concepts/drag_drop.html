            <p>Many classes have shortcut names used when creating (instantiating) a class with a
                configuration object.  The shortcut name is referred to as an <code>alias</code> (or <code>xtype</code> if the
                class extends Ext.Component).  The alias/xtype is listed next to the class name of
                applicable classes for quick reference.</p>
            <h3 id="access-levels">Access Levels</h3>
            <p>Framework classes or their members may be specified as <code>private</code> or <code>protected</code>.  Else,
                the class / member is <code>public</code>.  <code>Public</code>, <code>protected</code>, and <code>private</code> are access
                descriptors used to convey how and when the class or class member should be used.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Public</strong> classes and class members are available for use by any other class or
                    application code and may be relied upon as a stable and persistent within major product
                    versions.  Public classes and members may safely be extended via a subclass.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Protected</strong> class members are stable <code>public</code> members intended to be used by the
                    owning class or its subclasses.  Protected members may safely be extended via a subclass.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Private</strong> classes and class members are used internally by the framework and are not
                    intended to be used by application developers.  Private classes and members may change or
                    be omitted from the framework at any time without notice and should not be relied upon in
                    application logic.</p>

            </ul>
            <h3 id="member-types">Member Types</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Config</strong> - The configuration options for a class.</li>
                <li><strong>Property</strong> - Set once a class is instantiated. *See Read Only below.</li>
                <li><strong>Method</strong> - Actions that can be performed by a class.  Methods should be read as
                    instance methods and can only be called from a instance of a given class.  Static methods
                    that can be called directly from the class itself will have a <code>static</code> label next to the
                    method name.  *See Static below.</li>
                <li><strong>Event</strong> - Events are specific to the framework event system allowing for classes to
                    programmatically raise an event to be handled by one or more event handler methods.  DOM
                    events, while handled by the framework event system, are not specifically described
                    within the API documentation.  *For DOM events refer to the
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events">event reference</a> page from MDN.</li>
                <li><strong>Theme Variable</strong> - Variables used by the visual theme engine employed by the
                    framework.</li>
                <li><strong>Theme Mixin</strong> - Functions used by the visual theme engine employed by the framework
                    and may use values set in various Theme Variables.</li>

            <h3 id="member-syntax">Member Syntax</h3>
            <p>Below is an example class member that we can disect to show the syntax of a class member
                (the lookupComponent method as viewed from the Ext.button.Button class in this case).</p>
            <div style="position: relative;" class="show-inherited show-protected members">
                <div style="border: 1px solid #E4E4E4;" class="classmembers member-protected isNotStatic isInherited member-expanded" data-member-name="lookupComponent">

                        <i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i>
                    </div>
                    <div class="source-class"><a href="javascript:void(0);">Ext.container.Container</a><div class="viewSource"><a href="javascript:void(0);"></a><a target="_blank" href="javascript:void(0);">view source</a></div></div>
                    <div class="member-header">
                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="member-name-link"><span data-ref="method-lookupComponent" class="member-name"><strong>lookup</strong>Component</span></a>
                        <span class="params-list"> ( item )</span> : <span class="memberType">Ext.Component</span>
                        <div class="member-tags"><span class="protected">protected</span></div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Called when a raw config object is added to this container either during initialization of the <a href="javascript:void(0);">items</a> config,
                        or when new items are <a href="javascript:void(0);">added), or {@link #insert inserted</a>.</p>
                    <p>This method converts the passed object into an instanced child component.</p>
                    <p>This may be overridden in subclasses when special processing needs to be applied to child creation.</p>
                    <div class="detail-header">Parameters</div>
                    <p><span class="params-list">item</span> :

                    </p>
                    <div class="params-desc"><p>The config object being added.</p></div>
                    <div class="detail-header">Returns</div>
                    <span style="margin-left:12px;" class="memberType">Ext.Component</span>

            </div>
    
            <p>Let's look at each part of the member row:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Expand/Collapse</strong> - On the left-hand size of the member row is a control used to
                    expand and collapse each member row to show / hide member details.</li>
                <li><strong>Member Name</strong> - The name of the class member (<code>lookupComponent</code> in this example)</li>
                <li><strong>Method Param</strong> - Any required or optional params used by a method (or passed to an
                    event handler method) will be listed next to the method name within parenthesis
                    (<code>( item )</code> in this example)</li>
                <li><strong>Return type</strong> - The class instance or javascript object returned by the method or
                    property (<code>Ext.Component</code> in this case).  This may be omitted for methods that do not
                    return anything other than <code>undefined</code> or may display as multiple possible values
                    separated by a forward slash <code>/</code> signifying that what is returned may depend on the
                    results of the method call (i.e. a method may return a Component if a get method calls is
                    successful or <code>false</code> if unsuccessful which would be displayed as
                    <code>Ext.Component/Boolean</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Flags</strong> - Any flags applicable to the member will be displayed next (<code>PROTECTED</code> in
                    this example - see the Flags section below)</li>
                <li><strong>Member Origin</strong> - On the right-hand side of the member row is the class where the
                    member was initially described (<code>Ext.container.Container</code> in this example).  The source
                    class will be displayed as a blue link if the member originates from the current class
                    and gray if it is inherited from an ancestor or mixed-in class.</li>
                <li><strong>Member Source</strong> - On the right-hand side below the member origin class is a link to
                    view the member's source (<code>view source</code> in the example)</li>
                <li><strong>Params List</strong> - Each param for a class method will be listed using the same name
                    found above in parenthesis, the type of class or object expected, and a description of
                    the param (<code>item : Object</code> in the example).</li>
                <li><strong>Returns</strong> - If a class returns a value other than <code>undefined</code> a "Returns" section
                    will note the type of class or object returned and a description (<code>Ext.Component</code> in the
                    example)</li>
                <li><strong>Since</strong> (<em>not shown in the example</em>) - Some members will show which version of the
                    product the member was first introduced (i.e. <code>Available since 3.4.0</code> - <em>not pictured in
                        the example</em>) just after the member description</li>
                <li><strong>Default</strong> (<em>not shown in the example</em>) - Configs often show the default config value
                    to be applied to a class instance if not overridden (i.e. <code>Defaults to: false</code>)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="member-flags">Member Flags</h3>
            <p>The API documentation uses a number of flags to further commnicate the class member's
                function and intent.  The label may be represented by a text label, an abbreviation, or
                an icon.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Required</strong> - Required config when instantiating a class</li>
                <li><strong>Bindable</strong> - The config has a setter which allows this config to be set via ViewModel
                    binding</li>
                <li><strong>Read Only</strong> - The property may be read, but cannot be used to configure /
                    re-configure a class instance at runtime</li>
                <li><strong>Singleton</strong> - Singleton classes are instantiated immediately once defined and may not
                    be instantiated manually</li>
                <li><strong>Static</strong> - A static method or property is a method or property belonging to the class
                    itself, not an instance of the class</li>
                <li><strong>Chainable</strong> - Refers to methods that return the class instance back when called.<br>This enables chained method calls like: <code>classInstance.method1().method2().etc();</code></li>
                <li><strong>Deprecated</strong> - A class or member that is scheduled for removal in a future
                    framework version and is provided in the current version for backwards compatibility.<br>Deprecated classes and members will have a message directing you to the preferred class /
                    method going forward.</li>
                <li><strong>Removed</strong> - A removed class or member that exists in documentation only as a
                    reference for users upgrading between framework versions</li>
                <li><strong>Template</strong> - A method defined within a base class designed to be overridden by
                    subclasses</li>
                <li><strong>Abstract</strong> - A class or member may be be defined as abstract.  Abstract classes and
                    members establish a class structure and provide limited, if any, code.  Class-specific

            <h2 id="navigation-and-features">Navigation and Features</h2>
            <h3 id="class-member-quick-nav-menu">Class Member Quick-Nav Menu</h3>
            <p>Just below the class name on an API doc page is a row of buttons corresponding to the
                types of members owned by the current class.  Each button shows a count of members by
                type (this count is updated as filters are applied).  Clicking the button will navigate
                you to that member section.  Hovering over the member-type button will reveal a popup
                menu of all members of that type for quick navigation.</p>
            <h3 id="getter-and-setter-methods">Getter and Setter Methods</h3>
            <p>Getting and setter methods that correlate to a class config option will show up in the
                methods section as well as in the configs section of both the API doc and the member-type
                menus just beneath the config they work with.  The getter and setter method documentation
                will be found in the config row for easy reference.</p>
            <h3 id="history-bar">History Bar</h3>
            <p>Your page history is kept in localstorage and displayed (using the available real estate)
                just below the top title bar.  By default, the only search results shown are the pages
                matching the product / version you're currently viewing.  You can expand what is
                displayed by clicking on the <span class="icon-demo history-config"></span> button on the
                right-hand side of the history bar and choosing the "All" radio option.  This will show
                all recent pages in the history bar for all products / versions.</p>
            <p>Within the history config menu you will also see a listing of your recent page visits.
                The results are filtered by the "Current Product / Version" and "All" radio options.
                Clicking on the <span class="icon-demo history-clear"></span> button will clear the history bar as
                well as the history kept in local storage.</p>
            <p>If "All" is selected in the history config menu the checkbox option for "Show product
                details in the history bar" will be enabled.  When checked, the product/version for each
                historic page will show alongside the page name in the history bar.  Hovering the cursor
                over the page names in the history bar will also show the product/version as a tooltip.</p>
            <h3 id="search-and-filters">Search and Filters</h3>
            <p>Both API docs and guides can be searched for using the search field at the top of the
                page.</p>
            <p>On API doc pages there is also a filter input field that filters the member rows
                using the filter string.  In addition to filtering by string you can filter the class
                members by access level, inheritance, and read only.  This is done using the checkboxes at the top of
                the page.</p>
            <p>The checkbox at the bottom of the API class navigation tree filters the class list to
                include or exclude private classes.</p>
            <p>Clicking on an empty search field will show your last 10 searches for quick navigation.</p>
            <h3 id="api-doc-class-metadata">API Doc Class Metadata</h3>
            <p>Each API doc page (with the exception of Javascript primitives pages) has a menu view of
                metadata relating to that class.  This metadata view will have one or more of the
                following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alternate Name</strong> - One or more additional class name synonymns (in Ext JS 6.0.0 the
                    <code>Ext.button.Button</code> class has an alternate class name of <code>Ext.Button</code>).  Alternate class
                    names are commonly maintained for backward compatibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Hierarchy</strong> - The hierararchy view lists the inheritance chain of the current class
                    up through its ancestor classes up to the root base class.</li>
                <li><strong>Mixins</strong> - A list of classes that are mixed into the current class</li>
                <li><strong>Inherited Mixins</strong> - A list of classes that are mixed into an ancestor of the current
                    class</li>
                <li><strong>Requires</strong> - All classes required to be defined for the class to be instantiated</li>
                <li><strong>Uses</strong> - A list of classes potentially used by the class at some point in its
                    lifecycle, but not necessarily requried for the class to initially be instantiated</li>
                <li><strong>Subclasses</strong> - Classes that extend the current class</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="expanding-and-collapsing-examples-and-class-members">Expanding and Collapsing Examples and Class Members</h3>
            <p>Runnable examples (Fiddles) are expanded on a page by default.  You can collapse and
                expand example code blocks individually using the arrow on the top-left of the code
                block.  You can also toggle the collapse state of all examples using the toggle button on
                the top-right of the page.  The toggle-all state will be remembered between page loads.</p>
            <p>Class members are collapsed on a page by default.  You can expand and collapse members
                using the arrow icon on the left of the member row or globally using the expand /
                collapse all toggle button top-right.</p>
            <h3 id="desktop-vs-mobile-view">Desktop -vs- Mobile View</h3>
            <p>Viewing the docs on narrower screens or browsers will result in a view optimized for a
                smaller form factor.  The primary differences between the desktop and "mobile" view are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Global navigation will be located in a menu on the left-hand side accessible via the
                    hamburger menu icon.  The menu houses the following (on most pages):<ul>
                        <li>The name of the current product (as a link to the product landing page)</li>
                        <li>The Sencha icon used to navigate back to the documentation home page</li>
                        <li>The product menu drop-down button</li>
                        <li>Tabs of navigation trees for the API docs and guides</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Current context navigation and tools is located on the right-hand side accessible via
                    the gear icon.  The context menu houses teh following:<ul>
                        <li>The global search input field</li>
                        <li>(<em>API doc</em>) A "Filters" tab with the member filter, expand / collapse all examples
                            button, expand / collapse all member rows button, the access level filter checkboxes,
                            and the counts of each member</li>
                        <li>(<em>API doc</em>) A "Related Classes" tab containing the menu of metadata related to the

<p>One of the most powerful interaction design patterns available to developers is &quot;Drag and
Drop.&quot; We utilize Drag and Drop without really giving it much thought - especially when
its done right. Here are 5 easy steps to ensure an elegant implementation.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_defining_drag_and_drop">Defining drag and drop<a class="quick-link" href="#core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_defining_drag_and_drop"></a></h2>
<p>A drag operation, essentially, is a click gesture on some UI element while the mouse
button is held down and the mouse is moved. A drop operation occurs when the mouse button
is released after a drag operation. From a high level, drag and drop decisions can be
summed up by the following flow chart.</p>
<p><img src='images/dnd_drag_logic.jpg' alt='Ext Drag and Drop'/></p>
<p>To speed up our development, Ext JS provides us with the Ext.dd classes to manage the
basic decisions for us. In this guide, we will cover coding for the appearance and removal
of the drop invitation, invalid drop repair and what happens when a successful drop
occurs.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_organizing_the_drag_and_drop_classes">Organizing the drag and drop classes<a class="quick-link" href="#core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_organizing_the_drag_and_drop_classes"></a></h2>
<p>A first glance of the classes in the Ext.dd documentation might seem a bit intimidating. 
But, if we take a quick moment to look at the classes, we see that they all stem from the
DragDrop class and most can be categorized into Drag or Drop groups.  With a bit more time
and digging, we can see that the classes can be further categorized into single node and
multiple node drag or drop interactions.</p>
<p><img src='images/diagram.jpg' alt='Ext Drag and Drop'/></p>
<p>In order to learn about the basics of drag and drop we&#39;ll focus on applying single drag
and drop interactions to DOM nodes.  To do this, we&#39;ll utilize the DD and DDTarget
classes, which provide the base implementations for their respective drag and drop
behaviors. However, we need to discuss what our objectives are before we can start
implementing drag and drop.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_the_task_at_hand">The task at hand<a class="quick-link" href="#core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_the_task_at_hand"></a></h2>
<p>Lets say we&#39;ve been asked to develop an application that will provide a rental car company
the ability to place their cars and trucks in one of three states:  available, rented or
in repair status.  The cars and trucks are only allowed to be placed in their respective
&quot;available&quot; container.</p>
<p><img src='images/dnd_story.jpg' alt='Ext Drag and Drop'/></p>
<p>To get started, we must make the cars and trucks &quot;dragable&quot;. For this, we&#39;ll use DD. We&#39;ll
need to make the rented, repair and vehicle containers &quot;drop targets&quot;.  For this we&#39;ll use
DDTarget.  Lastly, we&#39;ll use different drag drop groups to help enforce the requirement
that cars and trucks can only be dropped into their respective &quot;available&quot; containers. Now
we can begin coding by adding drag operations to the cars and trucks.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_step_1__starting_with_drag">Step 1: Starting with drag<a class="quick-link" href="#core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_step_1__starting_with_drag"></a></h2>
<p>To configure the vehicle DIVs elements as dragable, we&#39;ll need to obtain a list and loop
through it to instantiate new instances of DD.  Here&#39;s how we do it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">    Ext.onReady(function() {
        // Create an object that we&#39;ll use to implement and override drag behaviors a little later

        var overrides = {};

        // Configure the cars to be draggable
        var carElements = Ext.get(&#39;cars&#39;).select(&#39;div&#39;);
        Ext.each(carElements.elements, function(el) {
            var dd = Ext.create(&#39;Ext.dd.DD&#39;, el, &#39;carsDDGroup&#39;, {
                isTarget  : false
            });
            //Apply the overrides object to the newly created instance of DD
            Ext.apply(dd, overrides);
        });

        var truckElements = Ext.get(&#39;trucks&#39;).select(&#39;div&#39;);
        Ext.each(truckElements.elements, function(el) {
            var dd = Ext.create(&#39;Ext.dd.DD&#39;, el, &#39;trucksDDGroup&#39;, {
                isTarget  : false
            });
            Ext.apply(dd, overrides);
        });
    });
</code></pre><p>All drag and drop classes are designed to be implemented by means of overriding its
methods. That&#39;s why in the above code segment, we have create an empty object called
overrides, which will be filled in later with overrides specific to the action we need. We
get of list of car and truck elements by leveraging the DomQuery select method to query
the cars container for all the child div elements. To make the cars and truck elements
dragable, we create a new instance of DD, passing in the car or truck element to be
dragged and the drag drop group that it is to participate in. Notice that the vehicle
types have their own respective drag drop group. This will be important to remember later
when we setup the rented and repair containers as drop targets. Also notice that we&#39;re
applying the overrides object to the newly created instances of DD using Ext.apply., which
is a handy way to add properties or methods to an existing object. Before we can continue
with our implementation, we need to take a quick moment to analyze what happens when you
drag an element on screen. With this understanding, the rest of the implementation will
fall into place.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_peeking_at_how_drag_nodes_are_affected">Peeking at how drag nodes are affected<a class="quick-link" href="#core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_peeking_at_how_drag_nodes_are_affected"></a></h2>
<p>The first thing you&#39;ll notice when dragging the car or truck elements around is that they
will stick wherever they are dropped. This is OK for now because we&#39;ve just begun our
implementation. What is important is to understand how the drag nodes are being affected.
This will aid us in coding for the return to their original positions when they are dropped 
on anything that is not a valid drop target, which is known as an &quot;invalid drop&quot;. The
below illustration uses FireBug&#39;s HTML inspection panel and highlights the changes being
made by when a drag operation is applied to the Camaro element.</p>
<p><img src='images/dnd_inspection.jpg' alt='Ext Drag and Drop'/></p>
<p>While inspecting the drag element during a drag operation, we can see a style attribute
added to the element with three CSS values populated: position, top and left. Further
inspection reveals that the position attribute set to relative and top and left attributes
updating while the node is being dragged around. After a the drag gesture completes, the
style attribute remains along with the styles contained therein. This is what we have to
clean up when we code for the repair of an invalid drop. Until we setup proper drop
targets, all drop operations are considered invalid.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_step_2__repairing_an_invalid_drop">Step 2: Repairing an invalid drop<a class="quick-link" href="#core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_step_2__repairing_an_invalid_drop"></a></h2>
<p>The path of least resistance is to repair an invalid drop by reseting the style attribute
that is applied during the drag operation. This means that the drag element would
disappear from under the mouse and reappear where it originated and would be quite boring.
To make it smoother, we&#39;ll use Ext.Fx to animate this action. Remember that the drag and
drop classes were designed to have methods overridden. To implement repair, we&#39;ll need to
override the b4StartDrag, onInvalidDrop and endDrag methods. Lets add the following
methods to our overrides object above and we&#39;ll discuss what they are and do.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">    var overrides = {
        // Called the instance the element is dragged.
        b4StartDrag : function() {
            // Cache the drag element
            if (!this.el) {
                this.el = Ext.get(this.getEl());
            }

            //Cache the original XY Coordinates of the element, we&#39;ll use this later.
            this.originalXY = this.el.getXY();
        },
        // Called when element is dropped in a spot without a dropzone, or in a dropzone without matching a ddgroup.
        onInvalidDrop : function() {
            // Set a flag to invoke the animated repair
            this.invalidDrop = true;
        },
        // Called when the drag operation completes
        endDrag : function() {
            // Invoke the animation if the invalidDrop flag is set to true
            if (this.invalidDrop === true) {
                // Remove the drop invitation
                this.el.removeCls(&#39;dropOK&#39;);

                // Create the animation configuration object
                var animCfgObj = {
                    easing   : &#39;elasticOut&#39;,
                    duration : 1,
                    scope    : this,
                    callback : function() {
                        // Remove the position attribute
                        this.el.dom.style.position = &#39;&#39;;
                    }
                };

                // Apply the repair animation
        this.el.setXY(this.originalXY, animCfgObj); 
                delete this.invalidDrop;
            }
        },
</code></pre><p>In the above code, we begin by overriding the b4StartDrag method, which is called the
instant the drag element starts being dragged around screen and makes it an ideal place to
cache the drag element and original XY coordinates - which we will use later on in this
process. Next, we override onInvalidDrop, which is is called when a drag node is dropped
on anything other than a drop target that is participating in the same drag drop group.
This override simply sets a local invalidDrop property to true, which will be used in the
next method. The last method we override is endDrag, which is called when the drag element
is no longer being dragged around screen and the drag element is no longer being
controlled by the mouse movements. This override will move the drag element back to its
original X and Y position using animation. We configured the animation to use the
elasticOut easing to provide a cool and fun bouncy effect at end of the animation.</p>
<p><img src='images/dnd_camaro_repair.jpg' alt='Ext Drag and Drop'/></p>
<p>OK, now we have the repair operation complete. In order for it to work on the drop
invitation and valid drop operations, we need to setup the drop targets.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_step_3__configuring_the_drop_targets">Step 3: Configuring the drop targets<a class="quick-link" href="#core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_step_3__configuring_the_drop_targets"></a></h2>
<p>Our requirements dictate that we will allow cars and trucks to be in be dropped in the
rented and repair containers as well as their respective original containers. To do this,
we&#39;ll need to instantiate instances of the DDTarget class. Here&#39;s how its done.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Instantiate instances of Ext.dd.DDTarget for the cars and trucks container
var carsDDTarget = Ext.create(&#39;Ext.dd.DDTarget&#39;, &#39;cars&#39;,&#39;carsDDGroup&#39;);
var trucksDDTarget = Ext.create(&#39;Ext.dd.DDTarget&#39;, &#39;trucks&#39;, &#39;trucksDDGroup&#39;);

// Instantiate instances of DDTarget for the rented and repair drop target elements
var rentedDDTarget = Ext.create(&#39;Ext.dd.DDTarget&#39;, &#39;rented&#39;, &#39;carsDDGroup&#39;);
var repairDDTarget = Ext.create(&#39;Ext.dd.DDTarget&#39;, &#39;repair&#39;, &#39;carsDDGroup&#39;);

// Ensure that the rented and repair DDTargets will participate in the trucksDDGroup
rentedDDTarget.addToGroup(&#39;trucksDDGroup&#39;);
repairDDTarget.addToGroup(&#39;trucksDDGroup&#39;);
</code></pre><p>In the above code snippet, we have setup drop targets for the cars, trucks, rented and
repair elements. Notice that the cars container element only participates in the
&quot;carsDDGroup&quot; and the trucks container element participates in the &quot;trucksDDGroup&quot;. This
helps enforce the requirement that cars and trucks can only be dropped in their
originating container. Next, we instantiate instances DDTarget for the rented and repair
elements. Initially, they are configured to only participate in the &quot;carsDDGroup&quot;. In
order to allow them to participate in the &quot;trucksDDGroup&quot;, we have to add it by means of
addToGroup. OK, now we&#39;ve configured our drop targets. Lets see what happens when we drop
the cars or trucks on a valid drop element.</p>
<p><img src='images/dnd_drops_no_onDragDrop.jpg' alt='Ext Drag and Drop'/></p>
<p>In exercising the drop targets, we see that the drag element stays exactly its dropped.
That is, images can be dropped anywhere on a drop target and stay there. This means that
our drop implementation is not complete. To complete it, we need to actually code for the
&quot;complete drop&quot; operation, by means of another override for the instances of DD that we
created some time ago.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_step_4__completing_the_drop">Step 4: Completing the drop<a class="quick-link" href="#core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_step_4__completing_the_drop"></a></h2>
<p>To complete the drop, we will need to actually drag the element from its parent element to
the drop target element using DOM tools. This is accomplished by overriding the DD
onDragDrop method. Add the following method to the overrides object.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var overrides = {
    ...
    // Called upon successful drop of an element on a DDTarget with the same
    onDragDrop : function(evtObj, targetElId) {
        // Wrap the drop target element with Ext.Element
        var dropEl = Ext.get(targetElId);

        // Perform the node move only if the drag element&#39;s
        // parent is not the same as the drop target
        if (this.el.dom.parentNode.id != targetElId) {

            // Move the element
            dropEl.appendChild(this.el);

            // Remove the drag invitation
            this.onDragOut(evtObj, targetElId);

            // Clear the styles
            this.el.dom.style.position =&#39;&#39;;
            this.el.dom.style.top = &#39;&#39;;
            this.el.dom.style.left = &#39;&#39;;
        }
        else {
            // This was an invalid drop, initiate a repair
            this.onInvalidDrop();
        }
    },
</code></pre><p>In the above override, the drag element is moved to the drop target element, but only if
it is not the same as the drag element&#39;s parent node. After the drag element is moved, the
styles are cleared from it. If the drop element is the same as the drag element&#39;s parent,
we ensure a repair operation occurs by calling this.onInvalidDrop.</p>
<p><img src='images/drag_and_drop_working_without_invitation.jpg' alt='Ext Drag and Drop'/></p>
<p>Upon a successful drop, the drag elements will now will be moved from their parent element
to the drop target. How does the user know if they are hovering above a valid drop target?
We&#39;ll give the user some visual feedback by configuring the drop invitation.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_step_5__adding_drop_invitation">Step 5: Adding drop invitation<a class="quick-link" href="#core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_step_5__adding_drop_invitation"></a></h2>
<p>In order to make drag and drop a bit more useful, we need to provide feedback to the user
on whether or not a drop operation can successfully occur. This means that we&#39;ll have to
override the onDragEnter and onDragOut methods Add these last two methods to the overrides
object.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">    var overrides = {
        ...
        // Only called when the drag element is dragged over the a drop target with the
same ddgroup
        onDragEnter : function(evtObj, targetElId) {
            // Colorize the drag target if the drag node&#39;s parent is not the same as the
drop target
            if (targetElId != this.el.dom.parentNode.id) {
                this.el.addCls(&#39;dropOK&#39;);
            }
            else {
                // Remove the invitation
                this.onDragOut();
            }
        },
        // Only called when element is dragged out of a dropzone with the same ddgroup
        onDragOut : function(evtObj, targetElId) {
            this.el.removeCls(&#39;dropOK&#39;);
        }
    };
</code></pre><p>In the above code, we override the onDragEnter and onDragOut methods, both of which are
only utilized when the drag element is interacting with a drop target participating in the
same drag drop group. The onDragEnter method is only called when the mouse cursor first
intersects the boundaries of a drop target while a drag item is in drag mode. Likewise,
onDragOut is called when the mouse cursor is first dragged outside the boundaries of the
drop target while in drag mode.</p>
<p><img src='images/drag_and_drop_working_with_invitation.jpg' alt='Ext Drag and Drop'/></p>
<p>By adding overrides to the onDragEnter and onDragOut methods we can see that the
background of the drag element will turn green when the mouse cursor first intersects a
valid drop target and will lose its green background when it leaves the drop target or is
dropped. This completes our implementation of drag and drop with DOM elements.</p>
<h2 id="core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_summary">Summary<a class="quick-link" href="#core_concepts-_-drag_drop_-_summary"></a></h2>
<p>Today, we learned how to implement end to end drag and drop of DOM nodes using the
first-level drag and drop implementation classes. From a high-level, we defined and
discussed what drag and drop is and how to think about it in terms of the framework. We
also learned that the drag and drop classes can be grouped by drag or drop behaviors and
whether or not they support single or multiple drag or drop operations. While implementing
this behavior, we illustrated that the dd classes help make some of the behavioral
decisions, and that we are responsible for coding the end-behaviors. We hope you&#39;ve
enjoyed this thorough look at some fundamental drag and drop operations with DOM nodes. We
look forward to bringing you more articles about this topic in the future.</p>
